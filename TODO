-deallocate memory
-write tests
-make it write to named temporary files? is that how it should work? or somehow clean up if it fails partway through
-write help text
-clean up the control flow
-write comments
-make it have an option to print the license, that's required by GPL right?
-use the #line thing, IF it's possible for the input file to result in errors in the generated code. But I don't think it will be (it is, but only if you use the same array name more than once)
-make it accept - to read from standard input
-add assembly support (and check, it might be faster...)
-confirm windows build in msvc, mingw, cygwin, msys
-test whether it works with unicode filenames on Windows
-add gperf-style support for adding text at the top and bottom of the .c file
