-get rid of the trailing comma in printed array by having write array remember current line length
-make line_length_ configurable
-make option to generate the header or not
-make it possible to configure other stuff
-make it write to named temporary files? is that how it should work? or somehow clean up if it fails partway through
-make it parse arguments, including at least --help and --version
-write help text
-make it possible to specify macro for array length, and name of array
-make it correctly generate relative path from .c file to .h file for header inclusion?
-make it willing to read from standard input
-make a myError function to reduce code size from all these error messages (or add libsvenmar as a dependency)
-make it have an option to print the license, that's required by GPL right?
-optimize for: speed of this program, generated file size, speed of compiling the generated file
-add options for generated text mode, something like: compact, aligned hex, octal, aligned decimal, etc...
-optionally write to temporary files first then move
-use the #line thing, IF it's possible for the input file to result in errors in the generated code. But I don't think it will be
-make it accept - to read from standard input
