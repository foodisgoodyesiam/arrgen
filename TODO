-make line_length_ configurable
-make option to generate the header or not

-make it parse arguments, including at least --help and --version
-write help text
-make it possible to specify macro for array length, and name of array
-make it correctly generate relative path from .c file to .h file for header inclusion?

-make a myError function to reduce code size from all these error messages (or add libsvenmar as a dependency)
-make it have an option to print the license, that's required by GPL right?
